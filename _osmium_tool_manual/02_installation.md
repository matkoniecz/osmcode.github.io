### Debian and Ubuntu

Packages called `osmium-tool` are available for Debian and Ubuntu systems.
(Do not install the `osmium` package, it is a very old version of the Osmium
library.) Depending on your system, the packages might be rather old. Debian
unstable and testing are tracking the development of Osmium closely. For
Debian Stable those new packages are available in the
[backports repository](https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/).

[are available](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/osmium-tool).
