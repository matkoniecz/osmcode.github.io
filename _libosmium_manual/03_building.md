title: Building Libosmium
---

Libosmium is a header-only library, that means that you do not have to build
anything. But you might want to build the tests, examples, benchmarks or the
documentation. This chapter explains how to do that.

Before building you need to install all the [dependencies](#dependencies).


## CMake

Libosmium uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) configuration system
available on all major platforms. CMake will generate a configuration for a
build system of your choice. On Linux and macOS this is usually GNU Make, on
Windows Nmake or MSBuild.


## Build types

CMake knows several different _build types_ that result in the use of different
compiler options and different build options (see below). By default the build
type `RelWithDebInfo` (Release with debug info) will be used, but you can
change this either by setting `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` in `ccmake` or on the command
line:

``` sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Dev
```

Here are the build types used for Libosmium:

| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` | Description
| ------------------ | -----------
| `Debug`            | Debug mode, no optimizations.
| `Dev`              | For Libosmium developers. All build options are set to ON and very strict compiler warnings are enabled.
| `MinSizeRel`       | Release mode, optimize for small binary.
| `RelWithDebInfo`   | Release mode with debug information compiled in. Use this unless the binaries generated are too big for you.
| `Release`          | Release mode.


## Build options

Depending on the build type (see above), different build options are `ON` or
`OFF`. You can change the settings in `ccmake` or on the command line with
something like

``` sh
cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
```

etc.

| Build option | Default | Description
| ------------ | ------- | -----------
| `BUILD_BENCHMARKS` | `OFF` (`ON` in `Dev` build) | Build the benchmark programs. You only need this if you intend to run the benchmarks.
| `BUILD_DATA_TESTS` | `OFF` (`ON` in `Dev` build) | Build the _data tests_. These tests need OSM test data from a different repository, so they are a bit more difficult to run. See chapter [Running Tests](#running-tests) for details.
| `BUILD_EXAMPLES` | `ON` | Build the examples in the `examples` directory.
| `BUILD_HEADERS` | `OFF` (`ON` in `Dev` build) | Only interesting for Libosmium developers. This will build every Libosmium header file by itself to check if the include dependencies are all set correctly.
| `BUILD_TESTING` | `ON` | Build the unit tests. See chapter [Running Tests](#running-tests) for details.


## Building on Linux and macOS

Linux: Osmium is developed on Linux and tested best on that system. Debian
Jessie (testing) and current Ubuntu systems come with everything needed for
Osmium. Debian wheezy (stable) and the Ubuntu LTS release 12.04 don't have
compilers current enough. If you are stuck on these systems, use a backported
compiler.

macOS: Osmium also works well on macOS with the exception of the parts that
need the mremap system call that is not available on macOS.

First clone Libosmium from the git repository (or install it in some other way):

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/osmcode/libosmium
cd libosmium
```

Then create a directory in which the build should happen. In this documentation
we will use the directory `build`, but you can choose any other name. You can
have several build directories at the same time with different build options
and they will not interfere with each other.

``` sh
mkdir build
cd build
```

The call CMake to create an initial configuration:

``` sh
cmake ..
```

CMake will check your system, determine locations of programs, include headers,
libraries etc. It will also set some default build options. You can then call

``` sh
ccmake ..
```

to enter a cursed-based tool that allows you to edit any configuration setting.
Use the cursor keys to choose any variable and press `Enter` to change it. Once
you are done, press `c` to configure and handle any errors that might appear.
You might have to do this step several times. Then press `g` to generate the
configuration and exit the program. For more advanced usage info, see the
`ccmake` help.

Now you can call

``` sh
make
```

to complete the build.

For Mac users: If you have clang 3.2 or newer, use the system compiler. If not
you have to build the compiler yourself. See the instructions on
https://clang.llvm.org/ .


## Building on Windows

You need a rather new Visual C++ compiler for this to work. Visual C++ 2013
(a.k.a 12.0) is __not__ supported. You'll need 2014 CTP or the 2015 Preview.
This is due to the limited C++11 support in earlier versions of Visual C++.

The easiest way on Windows is to use the
[windows-builds](https://github.com/mapbox/windows-builds) repository.

When the pre-requisites (Visual Studio 2014/2015, git) are in place, it should
not take more than these steps to compile libosmium:

```
git clone https://github.com/mapbox/windows-builds.git
cd windows-builds
settings.bat
scripts\build_libosmium_deps
scripts\package_libosmium_deps
scripts\build_libosmium vs
```

## Building on 32bit architectures

Osmium works well on 64 bit machines, but on 32 bit machines there are some
problems. Be aware that not everything will work on 32 bit architectures.
This is mostly due to the 64 bit needed for node IDs. Also Osmium hasn't been
tested well on 32 bit systems. Here are some issues you might run into:

* Google Sparsehash does not work on 32 bit machines in our use case.
  Support for it is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
* The `mmap` system call is called with a `size_t` argument, so it can't
  give you more than 4GByte of memory on 32 bit systems. This might be a
  problem.

Please report any issues you have and we might be able to solve them.


## Building the reference documentation

To build the documentation you'll need
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

After configuring with CMake as described above, call

``` sh
make doc
```

to create the reference documentation.


## Installing Libosmium

Call `make install` in the build directory to install the library. By default,
this will install the Osmium include files into `/usr/local/include/`.

The following external (header-only) libraries are included in the libosmium
repository:

* [gdalcpp](https://github.com/joto/gdalcpp)

If you want this library to be installed along with libosmium
itself when calling `make install`, you have to use the CMake options
`INSTALL_GDALCPP`.

(Libosmium versions 2.13 and before also included
[protozero](https://github.com/mapbox/protozero) which could be included
with `INSTALL_PROTOZERO`. Newer versions of libosmium don't include this any
more.)

(Libosmium versions 2.14.0 and before also included
[utfcpp](https://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/) which could be included
with `INSTALL_UTFCPP`. Newer versions of libosmium don't include this any
more.)


## If something didn't work

Here are some tips if your build failed:

* Make sure you have all dependencies installed. Sometimes it is not easy to
  see from the error message which dependency is missing.
* Usually CMake and Make are quite good at tracking what needs rebuilding when
  you change configurations etc. But sometimes they get confused. Try
  restarting from scratch with an empty build directory.
* Check the `cmake` output to see if there are any warnings.
* Try `cmake` with `-DOsmium_DDEBUG=ON` to see some more debug information.
* Run `make VERBOSE=1` to see the commands Make is calling.
* Check the advanced CMake configuration section below.


## Advanced CMake configuration

The following variables can be set in the CMake configuration to further change
the build. Changes here are usually not necessary though:

| Option                   | Description
| ------                   | -----------
| `BENCHMARK`              | If `BUILD_BENCHMARKS` is `ON`, this variable contains the semicolon-separated list of all benchmarks that should be built. The prefix `osmium_benchmark_` will be added to all executables.
| `EXAMPLES`               | If `BUILD_EXAMPLES` is `ON`, this variable contains the semicolon-separated list of all examples that should be built. The prefix `osmium_` will be added to all executables.
| `OSMIUM_WARNING_OPTIONS` | C++ compiler warning options used in `Dev` mode.


## Running clang-tidy

To check for problems in the source code not detected by compilers, you can run
the `clang-tidy` command. If it is installed and CMake found it, you can call
Make with the `clang-tidy` target:

``` sh
make clang-tidy
```

The configuration for clang-tidy is in the file `.clang-tidy`. It also contains
documentation on why certain warnings are disabled.

Running clang-tidy will take quite a while and might generate a lot of output.
You can redirect the output to a file using something like this:

``` sh
make clang-tidy >clang-tidy.log 2>&1
```


## Running CPPCheck

To check for problems in the source code not detected by compilers, you can run
the `cppcheck` command. If it is installed and CMake found it, you can call
Make with the `cppcheck` target:

``` sh
make cppcheck
```

This will check all `.hpp` and `.cpp` files and can take a while.
